# PRD: SonarQube Integration for Google Workspace MCP

## Introduction/Overview

Integrate the Google Workspace MCP server project with SonarQube for continuous code quality monitoring, following the same configuration patterns as the existing claude-memory-mcp project. This feature solves the problem of lacking automated code quality monitoring and analysis in the current project.

## Goals

1. **Code Quality Monitoring**: Implement continuous code quality analysis for Python codebase
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate SonarQube scanning in GitHub Actions workflow
3. **Quality Gates**: Enforce quality standards before code merges
4. **Coverage Tracking**: Monitor test coverage and maintain quality thresholds
5. **Consistency**: Match configuration patterns from claude-memory-mcp project
6. **Security Analysis**: Detect potential security vulnerabilities in code

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want automated code quality checks on every PR so I can catch issues early
- I want to see test coverage reports so I can identify untested code
- I want security vulnerability alerts so I can address potential risks

### As a Project Maintainer
- I want quality gates to prevent low-quality code from being merged
- I want consistent quality standards across all MCP projects
- I want visibility into technical debt trends over time

## Functional Requirements

1. **Project Configuration**: Create sonar-project.properties with appropriate settings for Python 3.11+ and source paths
2. **File Exclusions**: Set appropriate exclusions for test files, cache, virtual environment, config files, scripts, and logs
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate SonarQube scanning into GitHub Actions workflow with quality gate checks
4. **Coverage Reporting**: Generate and upload XML test coverage reports compatible with SonarQube
5. **Quality Standards**: Configure thresholds matching claude-memory-mcp project for coverage, duplications, and maintainability
6. **Security Scanning**: Enable security vulnerability detection and reporting
7. **Badge Integration**: Add SonarQube quality metric badges to project README (Quality Gate, Bugs, Coverage, Reliability, Security, Maintainability)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Custom SonarQube rules development
- Integration with other static analysis tools beyond SonarQube
- Historical code quality analysis migration
- Custom quality profiles (use default Python profile)
- Performance optimization beyond basic configuration

## Design Considerations

- Use existing SonarQube instance (http://44.206.255.230:9000) for consistency
- Leverage existing SONAR_TOKEN and SONAR_HOST_URL secrets from claude-memory-mcp
- Follow same badge layout and styling as claude-memory-mcp README
- Maintain existing project structure (src/, tests/, config/)

## Technical Considerations

- **Environment**: Use existing SonarQube instance, Python 3.11+ analysis support
- **Dependencies**: Requires pytest-cov for coverage reporting, GitHub Actions capability
- **Integration**: Work with existing src/ directory structure and MCP-specific patterns
- **Security**: Secure token handling, exclude sensitive configuration files
- **Performance**: Analysis should complete within 5 minutes

## Success Metrics

1. **Quality Gate Success**: No blocking quality gate failures on main branch
2. **Coverage Integration**: Test coverage reports properly uploaded and visible in SonarQube
3. **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions runs SonarQube analysis successfully on every PR/push
4. **Badge Functionality**: All quality metric badges display correct data from SonarQube dashboard
5. **Developer Adoption**: Quality gate status visible in PR checks

## Open Questions

- Should we start with permissive quality gate settings and gradually tighten them?
- Any project-specific quality thresholds beyond the claude-memory-mcp defaults?
- Should SonarQube analysis run on all branches or just main/PR branches?
