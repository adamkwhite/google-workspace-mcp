## Relevant Files

- `sonar-project.properties` - SonarQube project configuration file with Python settings and exclusions
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD with SonarQube integration
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration for test discovery and coverage reporting
- `requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies including pytest-cov for coverage
- `README.md` - Documentation updates for SonarQube integration
- `.gitignore` - Additional exclusions for SonarQube artifacts

### Notes

- SonarQube analysis requires XML coverage reports generated by pytest-cov
- Quality gate checks will run automatically on every PR and push to main
- Use `pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml` to generate coverage reports locally
