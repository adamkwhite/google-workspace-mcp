# Calendar Management Preferences

## Default Rules
- **Always check for conflicts** before creating new events
- **Find free time slots** automatically when scheduling
- **Default visibility**: Show as "free" unless specified otherwise
- **Time zone**: America/Toronto (EST/EDT)

## Scheduling Best Practices
- Use Pomodoro-style time blocks (25-30 minute chunks)
- Break larger tasks into connected time segments
- Show how time chunks connect to larger outcomes/milestones
- Leave buffer time between meetings when possible

## Event Creation Standards
- Include clear descriptions with actionable details
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "Project: Task Name")
- Set appropriate reminders based on task importance
- Consider existing calendar patterns and routines

## Conflict Resolution
- If conflict detected, automatically suggest 2-3 alternative time slots
- Prioritize morning slots for focused work when possible
- Respect existing recurring meetings and commitments
- Ask before moving existing events

## Notes
- User prefers fixed deadlines and accountability
- Works well with time-based chunks connected to larger goals
- Uses Google Calendar as primary scheduling system
