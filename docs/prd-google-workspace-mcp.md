# Product Requirements Document - Google Workspace MCP

## Product Overview
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to create and manage Google Docs, Sheets, and Presentations through natural language commands.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Claude cannot directly create Google documents, requiring users to manually create and populate documents based on AI-generated content. This breaks workflow continuity and requires context switching between applications.

## Solution
An MCP server that provides tools for document creation, allowing Claude to:
- Generate documents directly in Google Drive
- Populate content programmatically
- Organize in folders
- Share with collaborators

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Developers using Claude for content generation
- **Secondary**: Teams collaborating on document creation
- **Tertiary**: Automation workflows requiring document generation

## Core Features

### MVP (Current Phase)
1. **Google Docs Creation**
   - Create documents with titles
   - Add initial content
   - Place in specific folders
   - Share with email addresses

2. **Authentication**
   - OAuth2 flow for Gmail accounts
   - Token persistence
   - Auto-refresh

3. **Basic Error Handling**
   - API rate limit handling
   - Authentication errors
   - Network failures

### Phase 2
1. **Google Sheets Creation**
   - Create spreadsheets
   - Populate with data arrays
   - Add headers
   - Basic formatting

2. **Google Slides Creation**
   - Create presentations
   - Add slides with layouts
   - Insert text content

### Phase 3
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Document templates
   - Batch operations
   - Update existing documents
   - Rich formatting options

2. **Integration Features**
   - Link with google-drive-mcp
   - Cross-document references
   - Import/export capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Python 3.11+ runtime
- Google Cloud APIs enabled
- MCP server framework
- Local token storage

### APIs
- Google Docs API v1
- Google Sheets API v4
- Google Slides API v1
- Google Drive API v3

### Performance
- Response time < 2 seconds for document creation
- Handle 100+ requests/minute
- Graceful degradation on API limits

## Success Metrics
- Document creation success rate > 99%
- Authentication flow completion > 95%
- User setup time < 10 minutes
- Zero credential exposure incidents

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to create Google Docs from Claude so I can automate documentation
- I want to share documents immediately so my team can collaborate
- I want to organize documents in folders so they're easy to find

### As a Team Lead
- I want Claude to generate meeting notes in Google Docs
- I want to create spreadsheets with project data
- I want to prepare presentations from outlines

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: OAuth2 only, no password storage
- **Reliability**: Automatic retry on transient failures
- **Usability**: Single command setup process
- **Compatibility**: Works with regular Gmail accounts

## Constraints
- Must work within Google API quotas
- Cannot access documents user doesn't own
- Limited to creation operations (no deletion)
- Requires browser for initial auth

## Future Considerations
- Multi-user workspace support
- Template marketplace
- Workflow automation
- Integration with other MCP tools
