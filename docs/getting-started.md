# Google Calendar MCP - Getting Started

## Problem Definition
You need write access to Google Calendar from Claude to create, update, and delete events programmatically through natural language commands.

## Solution Proposals

### 1. Local MCP Server in Ubuntu WSL (Recommended)
**Pros:** Full control, secure local auth, all calendar features, native Linux environment
**Cons:** Requires WSL setup, local dependencies
**Complexity:** Medium

### 2. Windows-Native MCP Server
**Pros:** No WSL dependency
**Cons:** Windows Python environment complications, path issues
**Complexity:** Medium-High

### 3. Third-party Calendar Service
**Pros:** Plug-and-play
**Cons:** Limited features, subscription costs, data privacy
**Complexity:** Low

## Recommendation
**Use Ubuntu WSL MCP Server** - provides the best balance of features, security, and integration with Claude while maintaining full control over your calendar data in a native Linux development environment.

## Implementation Breakdown

### Phase 1: Basic Setup (1 Pomodoro)
- Install dependencies in WSL
- Configure Google API credentials
- Test authentication flow

### Phase 2: MCP Integration (1 Pomodoro) 
- Connect to Claude from WSL
- Test basic event creation
- Verify calendar synchronization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 Pomodoro)
- Multi-calendar support
- Attendee management
- Error handling refinement

## File Structure Created
```
~/Code/calendar-mcp/
├── src/
│   └── server.py          # Main MCP server implementation
├── tests/
│   └── test_server.py     # Unit tests for all functions
├── docs/
│   └── README.md          # Complete documentation
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
└── setup.py              # Automated setup script
```

## Quick Start Command (Ubuntu WSL)
```bash
cd ~/Code/calendar-mcp
# Copy credentials from Windows if needed:
cp /mnt/c/Code/calendar-mcp/credentials.json .
python3 setup.py
```

This will guide you through the complete setup process with clear error messages and next steps.

## Environment Benefits

**Ubuntu WSL Advantages:**
• Native Linux Python environment (no Windows path complications)
• Better integration with VSCode and Claude Code
• Seamless MCP toolchain compatibility
• Consistent with most Claude development workflows
• Easy package management with apt/pip

## Key Features Implemented
• **Create Events**: Full-featured event creation with attendees, location, description
• **Update Events**: Modify any aspect of existing events
• **Delete Events**: Remove events by ID
• **List Calendars**: Discover available calendars and their permissions
• **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
• **Security**: Local OAuth token storage in WSL, no credentials sent to Claude
• **Testing**: Unit tests for all major functions

The MCP server is ready to use immediately after setup and provides a seamless interface between Claude's natural language processing and Google Calendar's API, running in your preferred Ubuntu WSL environment.
